### Project 4 - Feed Reader Testing
#### Description:
In this project a web-based application has been given that contains reads RSS feeds.

#### Why this Project?
Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

#### How I did this project?
For a given web-based application, tests have been written based on Requirements using the JavaScript testing framework Jasmine.
* A test to check whether allFeeds contain URL and it is not empty.
* A test to check whether allFeeds contain a name and it is not empty.
* A new test suite called "The Menu"
* "The Menu" test checks whether the menu is hidden and toggles correctly.
* A new test suite called "Initial Entries"
* It checks whether the .feed container has at least one entry.
* A new test suite called "New Feed Selection" which checks whether the content of the feed changes each time.

#### How to run this project?
* Open the index.html file in your browser.
* Once all the tests are passed it appears at the bottom of the screen.
* The js/app.js file contains the necessary functions for the application.
* A new test suite is written in the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.

## Part 4 - Front-End Applications

### Project 5 - Restaurant Review Application
#### Description:
In this Project an application was provided, which was converted into a fully responsive web application and service worker cache feature was implemented to make it available for offline use and some accessibility features.

#### How to Run this application?
1. Download the Zip file or clone it in your local.
2. Inside the cloned folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and explore the app.

#### Leaflet.js and Mapbox:
This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

#### Note about ES6
Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. 

## Part 5 - Building with React
