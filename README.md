# Project Overview

In this project a web-based application has been given that contains reads RSS feeds.
## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

## How will I did this project?

For a given web-based application, tests have been written based on Requirements using the JavaScript testing framework Jasmine.
*Wrote a test that loops through an object allFeeds and checks whether the object has an URL and that URL is not empty.
*Wrote a test that loops through an object allFeeds and checks whether the object has a name and that name is not empty.
*Wrote a test suite called "The Menu" which checks if the menu is hidden and toggles properly on keypress.
*Wrote a test suite called "Initial Entries" which checks if there is at least one element inside the .feed container.
*Wrote a test suite called "New Feed Selection" which checks if the content loaded by loadFeed function each time is not the same.
